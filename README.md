# sql-challenge-employee-tracker

In this assignment, I will design, view and manage departments, roles, and employees in my company, so that I can organize and plan my business. We will be using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.


Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge-employee-tracker. 

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the SQL challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: EmployeeSQL.

Add your files to the folder.

Push all changes to GitHub.

==========

Data Modeling:
Inspect the CSV's and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/

Use the information you have to create a table schema for each CSV file. The breakdown should be:

Department:
    *id
    *.name

Role:
    *id
    *title
    *salary
    *department_id

Employee:
    *id
    *first_name
    *.last_name
    *role_id
    *manager_id
